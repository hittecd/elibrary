Title: eLibrary

Description:

We will implement an online library that maintains a number of eBooks and allows users to 'check out' copies of these books provided they have an account. The number of licences will be limited so that when all books are checked out, the eBook will not become available again until users 'return' their eBooks, or the checkout duration expires.

Functionality:

-- Customers can sign up

-- Customers can log in

-- Admin can log in

-- Admin can manage the eBook collection

-- Customers can 'check out' an eBook for a duration of time

-- Customers cannot check out more than a certain number of eBooks

-- Customers can 'return' an eBook before the duration if they are done with it

-- If the 'check out' duration expires, the eBook will be 'returned' automatically

Stretch functionally:

-- Implement access control to the eBook so the user can no longer access it after it is no longer in their inventory
